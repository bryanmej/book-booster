# BookBooster

We built this app to keep track of the books you have read 

- Technologies used include: Node, Express, Mongoose
- The database is connected to Mongo Atlas
- The login, sign up and authentication features were done with Passport.js, password encryption done with bcrypt
- In the front-end we have handlebars and bootstrap 4
- Connects to the API theysaidso.com through axios

First you have to sign up and login to be redirected to the profile page here you can add a book to your library,
get an inspirational quote of the day and go to library<br/>

When adding a book you must provide: Title, author, No. of pages, rating, comment and img url<br/>

If you click on a book in the library it will take you to the details of the book and will give you the option to edit
